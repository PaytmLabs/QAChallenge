# QA Challenge

Goal of this challenge is to see how familiar you are with automation testing and to check your creativity in discovering edge cases! Lets get started -

1. Please download our official app from https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.one97.hero&hl=en_CA
2. Define test flows for our app on amazon device farm ( you can use the trial version, we understand the limitations!)
